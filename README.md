## Overview

**MyDFIR SOC Challenge** is a free 30-day challenge designed to give hands-on experience as a SOC Analyst. It is ideal for learners with cybersecurity knowledge or certifications but minimal real-world practice. The goal is to gain practical SOC skills in detection, investigation, and incident response over a structured month-long program.

## Challenge Details

- Daily exercises covering SOC concepts and tasks.
    
- Hands-on tasks include:
    
    - Setting up a SIEM environment (ELK Stack).
        
    - Detecting threats and analyzing telemetry.
        
    - Conducting incident investigations.
        
    - Monitoring endpoints using Elastic Agents and Elastic Defend (EDR).

## Week-by-Week Learning Outcomes

**Week 1: ELK Stack Fundamentals**

- Deploy Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.
    
- Ingest endpoint logs, including Sysmon, for monitoring system activity.
    

**Week 2: Brute Force Attack Detection**

- Configure public SSH and RDP servers.
    
- Create alerts and dashboards in Kibana to detect brute force attempts.
    

**Week 3: Command & Control (C2) Awareness**

- Deploy Mythic C2 server and Apollo agent.
    
- Simulate attacks on endpoints to understand attacker tactics.
    

**Week 4: Incident Response & Ticketing**

- Integrate osTicket for alert management.
    
- Conduct investigations and document actions following incident response procedures.
